\title{Detect CpG Islands in DNA Sequences}
\arguments{
\item{sequences_df}{A data frame containing the sequences to be analyzed. It must have a column named \code{sequences} containing the DNA sequences. Optionally, a \code{headers} column can be included for sequence identifiers.}

\item{window}{An integer specifying the window size (in base pairs) for sliding analysis. Default is 100.}

\item{gc_threshold}{A numeric value representing the threshold for GC content to classify a window as a potential CpG island. Default is 0.5.}

\item{cpg_threshold}{A numeric value representing the threshold for the observed-to-expected CpG ratio to classify a window as a CpG island. Default is 0.6.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object visualizing the GC content and CpG islands across the sequences. The plot will show lines for GC content with shaded regions indicating the detected CpG islands.
}
\description{
This function identifies CpG islands in a set of DNA sequences by calculating the observed-to-expected CpG ratio and GC content within sliding windows. A CpG island is defined based on a threshold for both the GC content and the CpG ratio.

\examples{
# Example usage:
sequences_df <- data.frame(
 headers = c("seq1", "seq2"),
 sequences = c("ATCGCGATCGCGATCG", "CGATCGCGATCG"),
 stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Plot CpG islands
detect_cpg_islands(sequences_df, window = 10, gc_threshold = 0.4, cpg_threshold = 0.5)

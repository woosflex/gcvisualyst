\title{Visualize GC Content Across Sequences}
\arguments{
\item{sequences_df}{A data frame containing the sequences and their corresponding GC content windows. It is expected
that the data frame has at least two columns: \code{headers} (sequence identifiers) and \code{gc_content_windows} (list of GC content values).}

\item{combined}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, all sequences will be plotted on the same graph with a legend indicating the sequence
name. If \code{FALSE}, each sequence will be plotted in its own facet (subplot), and the legend will be removed.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing GC content across sequences. The plot will either display sequences in a combined
layout with a legend or in separate facets.
}
\description{
This function creates a line plot to visualize GC content across DNA sequences. The GC content is plotted over
sliding windows, either in a combined layout with a legend or in a facet-wrapped layout where each sequence is
plotted separately.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
sequences_df <- data.frame(
headers = c("seq1", "seq2"),
  gc_content_windows = I(list(
    c(0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.42),
    c(0.35, 0.38, 0.4, 0.37)
  ))
)
# Plot with all sequences combined in a single plot
gc_visualize(sequences_df, combined = TRUE)

# Plot with each sequence in a separate facet
gc_visualize(sequences_df, combined = FALSE)
